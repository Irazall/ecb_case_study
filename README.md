This repository contains a Quarto report that I had to create for a job application at the ECB in 2025. The report can be found in `output\ecb_case_study.pdf` while the Quarto file is in `scripts\ecb_case_study.qmd`. The data stems from the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) report on the global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions disseminated by the the European Commission. The data is published here: https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report_2024?vis=ghgpop#data_download (last retrieved on 26.01.2025).

# Task description

The European Commission regularly publishes the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) report on the global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions around the world. The latest data is published [here](https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report_2024?vis=ghgpop#data_download) (last retrieved 2025-01-26).\
\
Using data from the above website -- specifically, the data contained in the EDGAR GHG emissions files -- prepare three charts (with the specifications described below) and, alongside each chart, provide a maximum of three bullet points explaining the main data trends.

-   Chart 1 -- Evolution of GHG growth in the euro area, European Union (EU27) and worldwide;

-   Chart 2 -- Comparison of countries' GHG emissions per capita aggregated according to the World Bank income groups;

-   Chart 3 -- Contribution of individual country and continent GHG emissions to total world GHG emissions.

Moreover, describe the process and tools that you have used for creating your visualisations. Provide your answer in a PDF file format, not exceeding three pages.
